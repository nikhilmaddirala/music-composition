    @THAALAM - Introduction$

 Rhythm is an essential attribute of music.  Melodies have some natural points
 of accent or stress which occur at regular intervals of time and make people 
 tap their feet or clap the hands.  The inherent rhythm of a piece of music can 
 be felt even if their is no percussion instrument but percussion instruments 
 enhance the effect of rhythm.   In Carnatic Music rhythm is based on a scheme 
 of Thaalams or rhythmic cycles.  The term 'Laya' denotes the rhythmic aspect 
 of Carnatic Music.  At concert level rhythm is invariably provided by one or 
 more percussion instruments like the Mridhangam or Ghatam.  These instru-
 ments can also provide independent rhythmic movements (called  'Thani 
 Aavarthanam'). 

 Compositions are set to definite rhythmic patterns identified by the thaalam
 name.  The time unit of thaalam is known as Aksharam. The total number of 
 Aksharams in a cycle and the points of accent or stress distinguish one thaalam
 from another.  There is no absolute time unit prescribed and the tempo of a 
 composition can be altered according to the singer's needs but once chosen, 
 the time unit has to be maintained throughout the composition.  A cycle of 
 thaalam is known as '^Aavartham%'.

 Except in the case of Naadhaswaram the Raaga ^Aalaapana% or extempore 
 elaboration of a ^raagam% is not accompanied by a rhythmic instrument .~
  @The Angams (Parts) of Thaalams$
 Thaalams now in use have 3 ^Angam%s or parts called the '^Laghu%', '^Dhrutham%' 
 and '^Anudhrutham%' (except in the case of 'Chaapu thaalams'). The Angams are 
 defined by the manner in which the rhythm is kept by hand movements (Kriya).  
 Rhythm is kept by <beating or clapping> with the palm, <counting with fingers>
 and <waving (or turning up)> of the palm. A Laghu consists of a beat followed by 
 certain number of counts depending upon the '^Jaathi%' of the Thaalam.  A 
 Dhrutham is a beat and a wave while the Anudhrutham is simply a beat.   
 Normally the beginning of each of the Angams represented by the beat is also 
 the point of accent.  The time interval between any of these actions has to be 
 constant and each action is an aksharam. The units of time for a dhrutham is 
 always 2 and for anudhrutham 1, but the number of units for the laghu will 
 depend upon the jaathi of the thaalam.  The hand movements help in keeping
 rhythm of complex thaalams like the Ata thaalam having 4 angams with a total 
 of 14 aksharams in a cycle.
 
 The popular 'Aadhi' thaalam consists of 8 aksharams in a cycle divided into a 
 laghu with 4 units followed by 2 dhruthams of 2 units each.  Thus for the laghu
 (4 units)  the singer claps once and counts 3 times with fingers, and for the 2
 dhruthams he claps , turns the palm up, again claps and turns the palm up 
 to complete a cycle. You can see a <pictorial> representation of Aadhi thaalam
 and hear beats of Mridhangam and also see how a <song> is fitted into  the 
 rhythm cycle.~
   @ The 35 Thaalams now in use$

 The thaalam itself is defined by the number and order in which the different 
 angams appear.  Although ancient texts speak of 108 thaalams,  7 thaalams are 
 now in use - Dhruva, Matya, Roopaka, Jampa, Thriputa, Ata and Eka, each with 
 its own definition of angams.  Of the 3 possible angams laghu, dhrutham and 
 anudhrutham only laghu can have variable number of aksharams.  The number 
 of aksharams in the laghu is defined by the jaathi (class) of the thaalam.  The 
 jaathi names (which are prefixed to the thaalam) and their aksharams are:
 ^Thisra% (or ^Thrisra%) - 3, ^Chathusra% (or ^Chathurasra%) 4,  ^Khanda% - 5,  ^Misra% - 7,  
 ^Sankeerna% - 9.  Thus for instance Thriputa thaalam consists of a laghu followed 
 by two dhruthams. Thisra jaathi Thriputa thaalam, therefore, consists of a laghu 
 with 3 aksharams and two dhruthams of 2 aksharams each, giving a total of 7 
 aksharams.  The 'kriya' or action for laghu will be one clap or beat and  2 counts 
 giving a total of 3 aksharams.

 The 7 thaalams with 5 jaathis each give 35 thaalams.   To refer to a thaalam
 properly,  we have to mention both its jaathi and the name ( ex. 'Chathusra 
 Jaathi ^Matya thaalam%' or 'Khanda Jaathi ^Ata thaalam%' ). 

 There are 2 thaalams ^Misra% Chaapu and ^Khanda% Chaapu which are also in
 use and which do not have the laghu, dhrutham structure.~ 
  @Structures of the thaalams$

 Each thaalam has a normal ('default') ^jaathi% and when jaathi is not mentioned
 the normal jaathi is implied.  For jaathis other than the normal jaathi of a
 thaalam the jaathi has to be mentioned.  Thaalam structures are:
   
   Thaalam           Thaalam Structure             Normal Jaathi        Aksharams 

    Dhruva        Laghu,Dhrutham,Laghu,Laghu       Chathusra      4+2+4+4 = 14
    Matya         Laghu,Dhrutham,Laghu                   Chathusra         4+2+4 = 10
    Roopaka     Dhrutham,Laghu                              Chathusra             2+4 =  6
    Jampa        Laghu,Anudhrutham,Dhrutham        Misra                7+1+2 = 10
    Thriputa      Laghu,Dhrutham,Dhrutham             Thisra                3+2+2 =  7
    Ata              Laghu,Laghu,Dhrutham,Dhrutham  Khanda         5+5+2+2 = 14
    Eka             Laghu                                              Chathusra                         4

 Thus ^Ata thaalam% without mention of jaathi would mean ^Khanda% Jaathi Ata
 thaalam; for other jaathis of Ata thaalam we have to mention the jaathi. Aadhi
 thaalam is actually Chathusra Jaathi Thriputa (not the default for Thriputa). The
 order in which the thaalams are mentioned above is used historically ( ex- for
 ^Alankaaram%s in beginner' s lessons). Dheekshithar composed the first 7
 Navagraha Krithis starting from Sooryamoorthe (on Sun) in these seven      
 thaalams and in that order.~
   @Kaalam (Tempo)$         
 Once a composition is started the duration of an ^aksharam% has to be kept the
 same.   However, the music may have one note per aksharam, or 2 notes or 4 
 notes and so on thereby changing the duration of notes and making the music 
 appear faster. This aspect of Carnatic Music is called Kaalam. For lessons 
 up to the Geetham the first ^kaalam% is sung with one note or ^swaram% per 
 aksharam,  the second kaalam with 2 notes  per aksharam, the third with 4 notes 
 and so on. (A long note of double duration is counted as 2 notes.)  You can listen to 
 3 kaalams on <Mridhangam> in ^Aadhi thaalam% and notes of Maayaamaalava-
 gowla played on <Veena> in 4 kaalams. Varnams are written with 4 notes per 
 aksharam and often when Varnam is sung in 2 kaalams, the 'first' kaalam is with
 4 notes and 'second' kaalam is with 8 notes per aksharam.

 Although no absolute duration for aksharams is prescribed normally they take 
 between .5 and 1.2 seconds.  When aksharams are of longer duration the beats, 
 counts and waves may be repeated once to enable accuracy in time keeping.  
 This is called 'Two Kal(l)ai  Chowkam',  while the normal method is called 'one 
 ^kalai%'.   Aadhi thaalam with 2 kalai may appear to have 16 aksharams as each 
 count is repeated once i.e. 2 beats, 6 counts, 2 beats, 2 waves, 2 beats and 2 
 waves.  Listen to <2 kalai> in Aadhi thaalam-the repetition of action is indicated 
 by change in color of the arrow which remains in the same position.   Also listen 
 to one line of a <krithi >in 2 kalai.  Here the arrow moves with the flow of time.
 4 kalai chowkam (very slow) is sometimes used in Pallavis.~
   @ Generate 35 thaalams$
 You can generate any of the 35 thaalams by selecting from the menu below.
 Each thaalam has its own single name.  This name is shown at the top of the 
 thaalam generation screen.   This single name is rarely used except in the 
 case of 'Aadhi'  thaalam which is chathusra jaathi  thriputa thaalam and is   
 very popular.   Since the default thriputa thaalam is thisra jaathi the single 
 name is used for chathusra jaathi.   For other thaalams when default jaathi is 
 not used  the practice is to mention jaathi and thaalam name. The screen 
 enables you to vary aksharam duration and generate thaalam in two kalai. 
 The screen also uses  the term ^nadai%  which is explained in the next  screen
 The aksharam duration for thisra nadai will not be same as for 1 & 2 kalai 
 except for certain positions of the tempo bar~.
  @Gathi or Nadai$
 The normal method of counting kaalams involves 1,2,4,8 notes per aksharam 
 depending upon the kaalam.  As the most common usage is 4 notes  per  
 aksharam (or its sub multiples) this is called '^Chathusra% ^Gathi%'  or 'Chathusra
 ^Nadai%'.  (Even short phrases of music can have different kaalams in the same
 phrase.)  An aksharam can also have 3,5,7 or 9 notes (7  &  9  being very rare 
 and even 5 is not common).  When music is sung with  3 notes per aksharam 
 (similar to triple meter) it is in ^Thisra% Nadai.   5,7 or 9 notes per aksharam are 
 called  ^Khanda%, ^Misra% and ^Sankeerna% nadais.  Higher kaalams of these nadais
 use multiples of these numbers.  Listen to <thisra nadai>  and <khanda nadai>. 
 While keeping thaalam in thisra nadai, it is customary to count each aksharam
 by 2 quick repeat actions followed by one blank of the same duration.  For
 khanda nadai and additional action with a blank is used. Compositions in
 Thisra Nadai are common (Piraanavara  in  Kalyaani by Panchanatha Iyer,  
< Thonrunigazhndha>  (Chindhu)  by Subramania Bhaarathi).  For an example
 of nadai changing inside a ^krithi% see idadu.gka in Gaayaka.
 
 Sometimes the same composition is sung either in Chathusra Roopakam in 
 chathusra nadai (six aksharams with 4 notes per aksharam i.e. 24  (12  notes  
 of 2 cycles) or in  Aadhi thaalam  thisra nadai (eight aksharams with 3 notes per 
 aksharam again giving 24 notes in the cycle).  Listen to the krithi Naaradha Muni 
 in Panthuvaraali by Thyaagaraaja  in  <Roopaka-Chathusra Nadai> and in
 <Aadhi-Thisra Nadai>.~
  @Eduppu (Krithi's starting point)$
 
 A composition's melodic lines may start at the beginning of the thaalam cycle,  
 later or earlier.  Many compositions in Aadhi thaalam start after one and half 
 aksharams; sometimes this is called Dhesaadhi.  Many compositions which are
 composed for commencement at the beginning of ^aavartham% are often sung 
 leaving half aksharam in the beginning and contracting the time for the first  2
 syllables.  This is done for an illusory quickening in tempo and in subsequent
 variations the same line may start at the beginning of the thaalam cycle itself.  
 Commencing a composition after the beginning of thaalam cycle is termed as 
 'anaagatham' or 'thalli eduppu'  in Tamil.  According to the number of 
 aksharams skipped in the beginning it is termed as '^arai% idam' (half a place)
 or 'onrarai idam' (one and half  places).  Starting at the beginning of the cycle 
 is termed as 'sama eduppu'.  Compositions are also started at three fourths 
 aksharams and this is more common with compositions sung in slow tempo (2  
 ^kalai%  chowkam). 

 Rarely a composition may also commence before the beginning of the cycle.
 This is called '^Atheetha eduppu%'.  Audio-visual examples for some of the 
 'eduppus' are in the next screen.~
  @Eduppu - Examples$
 Audio-visual examples of Eduppu showing the first few aavarthams of some
 compositions are available in this screen. (All are in Aadhi thaalam of 8
 aksharams)

 <'Gajavadhana'> in Sreeranjani by Paapanaasam Sivan is an example of a
 krithi starting at half aksharam in the first line. The krithi starts at one fourth 
 aksharam in the second line. The music starts at the beginning of the cycle 
 (^Samam%) when the first line of the song is repeated after the second line. 

 <'Enthanerchina'> in Suddhadhanyaasi by Thyaagaraaja starts at one & half 
 aksharams after the beginning of the cycle.  The words of lyric also start one 
 and half aksharams after the first dhrutham. However, the accents come on the 
 beats.

 <'Vaathaapi Ganapathim'> in Hamsadhwani by Dheekshithar  starts at the beat
 in all lines.
  
 <'Sivakaama Sundhari'>  in Mukhaari by Paapanaasam Sivan starts one beat
 before the thaalam cycle (^atheetha eduppu%)

 <'Karpagame'> in Madhyamaavathi by Paapanaasam Sivan is an example of a
 1 ^kalai% krithi starting at three fourths aksharam.~
   @Chaapu  Thaalams$

 Two thaalams ^Misra% Chaapu and ^Khanda% Chaapu do not have the laghu, 
 dhrutham structure.  They have 7 and 5 units of time but the units are so short 
 that they can be said to have 3 and half and 2 and a half units.   Misra Chaapu
 is divided as 1 and half+1+1 units.  The first one and half units are marked by 
 two quick beats (or waves)  separated by half unit of time, then a gap of 1 unit 
 of time is given followed by two beats of 1 unit each totaling to  3 and half.   
 Listen to <Misra Chaapu>.

 Often while singing compositions in misra chaapu which provide for two   
 syllables in the 1 and half units of time the syllables are held for three fourths 
 of units of time each.  Many krithis in Misra Chaapu start after 1 unit from the
 beginning i.e. half a unit after the first 2 quick beats.   Listen to the krithi
<'Pakkala nilabadi'> in Kharaharapriya by Thyaagaraaja in misra chaapu, the
 first line starts after 1 unit but the second line starts at the beat. The syllables
 'mu' and 'u' are held for three fourths of units of time. 

 Khanda Chaapu is divided as 1+1 and half units.  The first 1 unit is marked by
 a beat and the second 1 and half unit by two quick beats separated by half 
 unit followed by one unit of time. Listen to <Khanda Chaapu> and the krithi
 <'Anupama'> in Ataana by Thyaagaraaja. The krithi starts at the beat.~
   @In Practice ..!$
 In practice some departures are seen from the theoretical definitions. The time 
 units of chathusra jaathi Roopaka thaalam in most krithis (except those of
 Dheekshithar) are much faster than for other thaalams so that the thaalam is 
 generally kept by beating twice and waving once i.e. as if it consists of an
 anudhrutham and a dhrutham with a total of 3 aksharams.   Many krithis
 originally composed in ^Misra% Jaathi Jampa thaalam (total 10 aksharams) are
 now sung in ^Khanda% Chaapu (2 and half aksharams). (Ex.Neevadanegana in 
 Saaranga by Thyaagaraaja).

 The thaalams mostly used are Aadhi, Roopakam and the two Chaapu thaalams. 
 Thyaagaraaja composed only in these and in Jampa which is now used as
 Khanda Chaapu.  ^Ata thaalam% is used in varnams.  Thiruppugazh  songs use 
 very  complex thaalams including those outside the 35 thaalams.  Often ^Misra% 
 Chaapu  krithis are shown in books as in ^Thisra% Thriputa (7 aksharams)  and 
 ^Khanda% Chaapu is sometimes referred to as ^Thisra% Roopakam (5 aksharams).

 The beginning of Angams denoted by a beat may not always be the points of 
 accent especially in 2 ^kalai% krithis having ^eduppu% at three fourths from the 
 ^aavartham% start.  The accents may come at the middle of the laghu and at the 
 second dhrutham.  Even in 1 kalai Aadhi the accents in the laghu and the 2 
 dhruthams (each 4 aksharams) may be identical so that the beat at the second 
 dhrutham has no special meaning.~
 @ Thaalam and Notation$
 The system for coding or writing notation for Carnatic  music is not quite 
 perfect.  It provides only an outline of the melody and does not depict graces 
 (gamakams) and pauses properly.  However, it shows the rhythm aspect fairly 
 correctly. The system divides the sheet into vertical columns each repre- 
 senting an ^angam% of the thaalam (such as laghu or dhrutham).  The top of the 
 column shows the type of angam. A vertical line followed by the number of 
 aksharams for the jaathi shows the Laghu ( |4 for ^chathusra% laghu). A circle 
 (O) is used for dhrutham and a semi-circle (U) for anudhrutham.  The swarams 
 are written on one line and the words of the melody on the next  line just 
 below the corresponding swarams.  See next page for explanations~
  @Notation - explanations$
 The sample is 2 sangathis (variations) of "Marivere" in Shanmukhapriya in
 ^Aadhi thaalam% (chathusra thriputa) with 8 aksharams.  The notes are written 
 on one line and the words of melody on the next line.  Each short note (like 
 'sa') counts as one note and long note ('saa') counts as 2 notes.  For longer 
 duration notes or for pauses a comma (',') is used for one note and a semi-
 colon (';') for 2 note duration.  A line drawn above the note shows that the 
 duration is halved and a double line means that the duration is 1/4 of normal. 
 The '/' shows upward movement of note and '\' downward movement and 
 does not affect the time measures.  Usually notation is written in ^kaalam% 3 
 (4 notes per aksharam) but this may vary and one has to find out the notes
 per aksharam by counting.  Press PgDn for further explanation.~
  @Notation - explanations$
 The first Laghu has 3 semicolons, 'paa daa paa' (3 long notes), a semicolon
 and pa ma (2 short notes).  The semicolons account for 4 X 2 eight notes and
 3 long notes for 3 X 2 = six notes and with the 2 short notes there are 16 note
 durations for the 4 aksharams of Laghu.  In the second dhrutham of the 
 second line the 'ree ga ri'  (2 + 1 + 1) note duration is halved due to the line
 above and becomes 2 notes and with  'ni sa' and 'sa ni' works out to 8 notes
 for the Dhrutham (2 aksharams).  Others can be checked similarly.  The 3
 semicolons in the beginning without melody show that the '^eduppu%' is 1 and
 half aksharams from the beat.  ~
  @Notation - explanations$
 In writing the note names a dot above indicates higher octave and a dot below
 shows lower octave.  In this package, however, higher octave is shown by the
 first letter of the note in upper case and for lower octave the second and subse-
 quent letters are shown in upper case. There is generally no indication of the 
 ^kaalam% in which the notation is written.  If you find 8 ^swaram% units in four
 aksharams you may infer that the kaalam is second.  Very often Chathusra 
 Roopakam is treated as a thaalam with two beats followed by one wave and
 the notation may show only 12 swarams for the whole aavartham.   Generally
 there is no indication for ^Gamakam% except '/' and '\' for slides but sometimes
 a wavy line above the note is written to indicate kampitham.~
