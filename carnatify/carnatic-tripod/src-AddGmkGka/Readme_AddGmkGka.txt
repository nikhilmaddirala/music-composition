Readme file for AddGmkGka.zip

The program addgamakam,.exe can convert skeletal Carnatic Music notation (in Gaayaka format) into notation with gamakams.  Input can be either an existing .gka file or manually typing the notation. Choosing the ragam and clicking 'Convert' generatrest an output of converted notation which can then be played in Gaayaka (which is a Carnatic Music Notation player using 'sa ri ga ma....' type input).

There is no setup program. The zip contains executable addgamakam.exe, supporting files and ragam definition files (and this Readme file).  In addition it also contains the later version of Gaayaka (gka7.exe) along with supporting files and sample .gka files as in the main Rasika package. (This version of Gaayaka  is specially suitable for converted notation which may have alternatives in some cases.)  You can extract all the files (including the folders in the zip file) into a separate new folder in your PC and run addgamakam program (addgamakam.exe) or Gaayaka program  (gka7.exe).

As there is no setup program shortcuts on Desktop or Program menu are not created. The programs have to be run by double clicking on their names in Windows Explorer.  If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7, when you run the programs first you have to run as Administrator - by right clicking in Windows Explorer and clicking 'Run as Administrator' and accepting the warning

For experimenting, some plain notation files have  been provided in separate folders with ragam names.

The zip file contains AddGamakahHelp.pdf  which is the help file for addgamakam program. 
The help for Gaayaka can be invoked from the program by pressing F1 or through the Help menu.

Using Gaayaka requires knowledge of Carnatic Music Notation system and theory.  RasikaV2 package will help you. See http://carnatidc2000.tripod.com
