<center><h2>Rasika Software Package - Instructions</h2></center>

RasikaV21 Software package is free and therefore there are no guarantees. The version (2.1) given here does not have any ActiveX controls to be registered and consequently can be run by simply copying the files. (Many users are wary of installation programs as they write into the Windows Registry.) <p>

The software works only with Windows OS (Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1). There are no Linux, Mac or Android versions. Also it may not work with Windows emulations like WINE or Mac Parallels or in other virtual environments. <p>

You can use all the programs in Rasika by extracting the files and folders from the RGS213FR0_CP2.zip file (from which you have opened this file) to a new folder in your PC/Laptop. <p>

Open Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder where you have saved the zip file and double click on the file name RGS213FR0_CP2(.zip). The zip folder will open and you will see 'Extract All files' on top left below the menu line. Click this. The new window 'Select a Destination and Extract files' will show a default folder which will be a sub folder under the folder where you have saved the zip file. This will not be convenient. You may like to save the programs in another drive. Type the destination giving full path. I suggest the name 'RasikaV21' for the new folder to save the files but you can choose any other name. If you want to save the files in C: drive then type C:\RasikaV21. To save in D: drive type D:\RasikaV21 and click 'Extract' at bottom right. The folder will be created and the files will be extracted along with sub-folders in the zip file. That is all.<p>

[The above instructions re: extracting files are based on the presumption that you are not using any other zip program for handling zip files. If you are using some other program then use the procedure you normally use, but make sure that the subfolders in the zip file are also copied as subfolders with the same names and contents. (Some zip programs extract and put all the files in one folder, which can give you 'file not found' error). The sub folders are LesnGka, Allied, LesnSynt, LesnVoc(empty) and Novice. Files in the folders in zip files are to be copied into corresponding folders under the new RasikaV21 folder]<P>

You can run the programs now by double clicking on the program names in Windows Explorer or by typing 'Run' in 'Start', browsing to the RasikaV21 folder and choosing the program. For a brief description of the different programs see Overview21.chm.<p>

<B>IMPORTANT: If you are using Windows Vista,Windows 7 or Windows 8, you have to run each program once as 'Administrator' to avoid getting errors.</B> To run as Administrator, right cllick on the program name in Windows Explorer and click 'Run as Administrator' in the pop up menu and accept the warning that it is an unknown program. <p>If you like you can create required short cuts on the Desk Top and Start Menu (Start Screen in Windows 8) yourself.<p>

The programs are: <p>

The programs can be recognised by the Thambura like icons for all programs except the Sruthi Box which has a Sruthi Box like icon.<P>
*By opening Gka7Open(.exe) you get a screen from where you can ascess all programs except Rasika. You can make a short cut to it on your Desktop.<br>
**There is also a file WavAudio2.exe which is an earlier version but does not handle .mp3 files with Variable Bit Rate (VBR) correctly. WavAudio3.exe may load some files more slowly. If you have problem with WavAudio3.exe use WavAudio2.exe<p>

<b>Help Files:</b> If you had downloaded the files recently you may find that the help file accessed from the 'Help' menus of the different programs show 'Navigation to the web page cancelled'. The help files are in .chm format and the trend is to block them as potentially harmful. To get around this problem, go to the folder where you have extracted the Rasika package files from the zip file. Look for files with extension .chm or type described as 'Compiled HTML Help file'. If extension is not seen, the files can be identified by the Icon which has a yellow question mark picture. There are 7 such files. Right click on each, select 'Properties' from the pop up menu. In the properties window on the right bottom you have a button 'unblock'. Click this and click OK. You will now be able to see the help files when accessed from the program. The files have been individually checked with anativirus software

<strong>AddGamakam Program:</strong><p>

See <a href=http://carnatic2000.tripod.com/autogamakam.htm>http://carnatic2000.tripod.com/autogamakam.htm</a> where the author has mentioned about his efforts to write a program to generate appropriate gamakam automatically based on the raagam characteristic. The program and gamakam definition files for 16 raagams are now avalable for free download at http://carnatic2000.tripod.com/addgmkdl.htm OR http://heliohost.org/RGSET/addgamakam.zip which has necessary instructions. The file mentioned there for downloading (AddGmkGka.zip)is meant for users not having Rasika. Since you will be installing Rasika using one of the procedures mentioned above <a href=http://carnatic.heliohost.org/RGSET/addgamakam.zip>Download addgamakam.zip</a> and extract the files in the same folder in which you have installed Rasika. Read AddGamakamHelp.pdf and run AddGamakam.exe and try some plain notation files for automatic insertion of gamakams.
