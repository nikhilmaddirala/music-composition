@Getting Started$

 Welcome to the world of Carnatic Music - the South Indian Classical Music
 system.   Carnatic Music has a well organized system and this package is
 to enable you appreciate it as it is practiced  today.  In this Introductory
 Module you will get familiar with some of the basics of the Carnatic Music.

 The modules (except the Raagam module) are organised as a continuous
 text narratives with 'links' or 'hot spots' to audio, visual or audio-visual. 
 These links are in green color and underlined. The cursor changes into a
 hand symbol at such links. When you click a link you may just hear a sound,
 or another window may popup in which there may be buttons for producing
 audio.  {If the new window does not have a 'close' button, click anywhere on
 the text area or the blue background} outside the text or press 'ESC' to close
 the window, stop any audio and take you back to the text. Audio without
 a new window can also be stopped similarly except when the clip is short.

 Clicking the words in Red or Brown color will show a pop up window wth
 explanation of the term (direct access to glossary). To go to another page
 direct  use the 'Contents Menu'.  To go to other modules, click the 'Module'
 menu and choose required module. The 'Module' menu also has the 'Exit'
 submenu to quit the module and return to the opening screen. To locate a
 module with a particular topic use the 'Index (to All Modules)' menu. ~
 @Musical Note - Pitch $ 

 There are many musical forms in Carnatic Music such as ^Krithi% (compositions),
 ^Aalaapana% (extempore elaboration), ^Kalpana Swaram% (extempore solfa),
 ^Thaanam% etc.  But the common and essential ingredient of all the forms is the
 ^Raagam% around which revolves the entire Carnatic Music system.  It is difficult
 to explain the raagam system without the use of technical terms like 'note'  
 (^Swaram%),' pitch'  ('Swarasthaanam'), 'octave' ('^Sthaayi%') etc. If you have a good
 idea of these,  skip to next page.

 A musical note is a sound with a steady or regularly varying pitch. Pitch is a 
 musical term and is related physically to the sound's frequency. The Indian term
 '^Swaram%'  means  'pleasant by itself'.  Listen to samples of musical notes on  
 <Violin>, <Veena>, <Flute> and also to a <non musical sound>.  Listen to some 
 notes with <increasing> pitch and <decreasing> pitch.  Notes of the same pitch 
 may be produced by different  instruments like <Violin> and <Flute> differing in 
 'quality' or  'timbre' of the sound.  For more on the technical aspects of sound 
 and music see the <Physics and Music> module  ~
 @Musical Relationship - Aadhaara Sruthi$    

 Musical notes may be sounded in succession to produce <melody> or simul-
 taneously to produce <harmony>.   In either case the notes  should have
 certain pitch relationships for producing music.  Listen to a series of notes 
 <without musical relationship> and another <with musical relationship>. 
 Notes which have mutual musical relationships are denoted by symbols.

 In Carnatic Music one note is taken as the 'Aadhara ^Shadjam%' and is given the
 symbol '^sa%'.  The term 'Aadhara' implies that the note is the foundation on which
 the music rests and other notes are related to it. The Aadhara Sa sounds as the
 basis of the music which has an inherent tendency to return to it and most
 compositons end in it. The artist often ends his alapana (extempore raga
 singing) also in the Aadhara Sa. Unlike in western music, the artist is free
 to choose a pitch suitable to his voice as Aadhara Sa and for that concert or
 song the chosen pitch becomes sa. The importance of Aadhara Sruthi has led to
 the use of a drone in the background for all Carnatic Music renderings. This
 drone is provided by a <Thamboora> or a Sruthi box, which produce the
 Aadhara sa, its fifth note pa and sa of higher octave  (see topic E for an  
 explanation of octave) in Sruthi Box and lower octave in Thamboora.  However,
 even when there is no drone the artist constantly keeps the Aadhara Sa in his
 mind and the listener subconsciously feels it.~
 @Aadhaara Sruthi - Audio Samples$
 Listen to how it feels when the same melody is played in different Sruthis.
 
 Listen to ^Pallavi% of <'Ennathavam'> in Raagam Kaapi played with 'C' 
 of the keyboard as Aadhaara Sa. The piece ends in the Aadhaara Sa. Listen to
 the Aadhaara <sa,  the fifth (pa) and Sa> of upper octave for this key (the  
 traditional 'sa pa Sa' that every student sings before starting his class!). Listen
 to the <Thamboora alone.>

 <Listen> to to the same piece played with 'E' as Aadhaara sruthi .
 Listen to <sa, pa, Sa> in this sruthi and listen to the <Thamboora alone>.

 <Listen> to the same piece played with 'G' as Aadhaara sruthi .
 Listen to <sa, pa, Sa> in this sruthi and listen to the <Thamboora alone>.

 In Carnatic music there is no essential difference among these three 
 renderings. Within a few seconds the listener adjusts to the new tonic.
 The Thamboora tuned to the tonic makes it easier to feel Aadhaara Sruthi.
 In most cases the melody would end at the Aadhaara Sa, but it can end
 at other notes also as in the example below:

 Listen to Pallavi of <Enthanerchina> in Raagam Suddhadhanyaasi played 
 with 'E' as Aadhaara Sa. The piece ends in Pa of the middle octave.
 Listen <sa pa Sa> in this sruthi and listen to the <Thamboora alone>
~

 @Symbols for the Notes - Octave $

 Most musical systems use seven symbols to denote the notes.  In Carnatic
 music the symbols used for notes (in ascending pitch) are ^sa%,^ri%,^ga%,^ma%,^pa%,^da%,^ni% 
 (which may be said to correspond to the western c,d,e,f,g,a,b).   While singing
 solfa the same symbols are used.  Any convenient pitch can be chosen as 'sa'
 which is the tonic and the rest related to it.  The (eighth) note after the seventh
 has the same symbol as the first and the symbols are repeated when we go
 higher in pitch as in sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni-Sa-Ri-Ga...  While descending below
 sa, again the symbols are repeated as in ri-sa-nI-dA-pA...  The range from the 
 note sa to the higher Sa is known as the <Octave>.   In Carnatic Music the   
 middle range from the tonic to its eighth note Sa is known as ^Madhya% ^Sthaayi%, 
 the octave above this as ^Thaara% Sthaayi and the Octave below the tonic sa as   
 ^Mandhra% Sthaayi.     

 The accepted method of writing notation is to put a dot above or below the note 
 symbol for upper and lower octaves.  In this package Madhya Sthaayi notes are 
 shown in lower case  ( sa ri ga ma pa da ni), Thaara Sthaayi notes with the first 
 letter in upper case (Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa)  and Mandhra Sthaayi notes with the 
 second letter in upper case (mA pA dA nI).~
@Aadhara Sruthi - the 'Kattai' system$

 In Carnatic Music the '^Kattai%' system is used to refer to the Aadhara Sa chosen
 by the artist. The pitch of the first white key on the standard Harmonium or the
 keyboard (or its higher octave) is referred to as 1 kattai, the second white key
 as 2 kattai and so on. The black key in between 2 white keys gets half added
 to the kattai number of the previous white key.  See the <illustration>.  With
 the advent of Electronic Thamboora and Electronic Sruthi Box the western
 symbols of C,D,E,F,G,A,B are also used nowadays to refere to the Aadhara
 Sruthi chosen. The choice of Aadhara Sruthi to coincide with the keys of the
 Harmonium or keyboard helps the accompaniments in using appropriate
 instruments as instrumnets like Mridangam do not allow considerable up or
 down tuning.

 For theoretical discussions in this package, the Western Music symbol 'C'  is 
 taken to be the equivalent of  'sa'  of Carnatic Music.  The keyboard visuals
 (except in Raagam Module) use C as ^sa% which means that the aadhaara
 sruthi is 1 ^Kattai% The key positions will change if some key other than C
 is chosen as aadhaara sruthi. In the Raagam module the user can change the
 Aadhara Sruthi but the Keyboard visuals will still show te Sa at the C  position.
 The topic 'O.Key Transpose Chart' in the Melam module shows how the keys
 chosen change when the Aadhara Sruthi is changed.~
 @7 names for 12 notes$

 Though only 7 symbols are used, actually most musical systems use 12 notes in  
 an octave.   In Carnatic music out of the 7 symbols  five - ^ri%,^ga%,^ma%,^da% and ^ni% 
 refer to more than one note.  Thus there are <4 different> ways for playing
 the notes sa-ri-ga.  (in fact 6 different ways in the more complex system now 
 used and which is explained in the ^Melam% Module).  

 The 12 notes in an octave can be seen on the keyboard of  <Piano> or similar 
 keyboard  instruments.  The 5 black keys are the extra notes to make up the 12.  
 On the guitar or the <Veena> there are 12 frets in an octave.  You can see that
 on the keyboard of the seven white notes <two pairs - ga-ma and ni-Sa> do
 not have any black key in between. The pitch of these two pairs are closer than
 the pitch distance between the other white pairs but once we have 12 notes the
 pitch relationship between any two adjacent notes (black or white) is the same 
 on the keyboard and roughly same on the ^Veena%. 

 The Piano keyboard picture shows the notes with C as sa.   If some other key is 
 chosen as the tonic the positions will be different.  <View> the note positions
 when E is chosen as tonic (3 ^Kattai% ^Sruthi% - as E is the third note from C).

 It is the choice of notes (usually seven or less) from these 12 notes (with some 
 restrictions) that leads to the variety of moods in Carnatic Music. ~
 @Raagam - Basis of Carnatic Music System$
 Carnatic Music is essentially melodic in nature.  Limited Harmony is implicit
 in the coalescence with ^Thamboora% and occasionally used in playing some
 notes on instruments.   ^Raagam% is the central concept of Carnatic Music. 
 Raagam may be said to be a melodic mood.  Indian music tends to dwell on 
 a single mood or emotion for considerable length of time (one of the reasons 
 for repeating phrases without change or with slight change).  Carnatic songs
 are always set to some raagam (sometimes to a succession of raagams) but the
 raagam can also be sung as phrases without a lyric (^aalaapana%). Listen to 
 some samples - part of a song in raagam <Saaveri>, a song in <Hindholam> and
 phrases of raagams <Sahana> and <Kalyani>.  A special feature of Carnatic 
 Music is that in addition to <straight> notes, smooth <movements> from one note 
 to another and <oscillations> between notes or around a note are extensively 
 used.  Such movements are called ^Gamakam%s without which many Carnatic 
 raagams will not be recognisable. 

 Technically a raagam is defined by the choice of notes (from among the 12  
 notes), their ascending and descending sequences called ^Aarohanam% and 
 ^Avarohanam%, the nature of ^Gamakam% (or absence of it) on different notes and 
 by {characteristic phrases} or groups of notes, the last because in Carnatic 
 Music raagams are highly phrase oriented.  While the notes provide the 
 skeleton of the raagam , the gamakams and the manner in which notes are 
 used are its  'flesh and blood'. ~
 @Raagam -Classification$

 The present classification of raagams is based on the scheme of '^Janaka%' and 
 '^Janya%' raagams (parent and child).   A ^raagam% which uses all the seven notes 
 and has a normal straight  (not '^Vakra%' -see below) ascent and descent is a 
 Janaka Raagam (also called ^Melakartha%).  Others are 'born' out of them.  As 
 ^ri%, ^ga% ,^ma% ,^da% and ^ni% can take 2 variations (the black or the white notes on the 
 keyboard) a simple scheme can provide 32 possible combinations (2 x 2 x 2 x 2 
 x2).  Actually 72 combinations are now used based on a slightly more complex 
 scheme for the Janaka raagams (Venkatamakhi's  Melams - handled in detail
 in the ^Melam% module) but the bulk of raagams in use come under the 32. 

 The Janya raagams as a rule have to use the same variety of the 5 notes   
 ri, ga ma da ni as in the parent Raagam but may omit some of them or even ^pa% 
 and may also have a devious or '^Vakra%' ascent or descent (such as sa-ga-ri-ga-
 ma-pa-da-pa-Sa in ^aarohanam%  - coming down to ri after ga and to pa after Da 
 and then going up ). Of the 4 raagams of the previous screen, 3 are Janya
 raagams.  See and  listen to the Aarohanam-Avarohanam of the Janaka and 
 Janya for <Saaveri> (parent Maayaamaalavagowla), <Sahaana>,  (parent   
 Harikaambodhi) and <Hindholam> (parent Natabhairavi).  Saaveri omits ^ga% and 
 ^ni% in ascent.  Sahaana is an example of Vakra ascent and descent.  Hindholam  
 omits ^ri% and pa.  Also listen to ascent and descent of <Kalyaani>, a Janaka (or 
 ^Melakartha%) Raagam.~
 @Bhaashaanga Raagams$

 There are some exceptions to the rule that a ^Janaka% ^Raagam% should use only 
 the same variety of notes for ^ri%, ^ga%, ^ma% , ^da% and ^ni% as the parent  Raagam.  
 Some raagams use the other variety of a note {in addition} to the variety of that
 note in the parent Raagam.  Such raagams are called Bhaashaanga Raagams. 
 Such notes not found in the parent Raagam are known as 'Anya' (foreign) 
 swarams and may be used only in selected phrases or only in the ascent or 
 descent.   However, the ^Anya Swaram% and the normal ^Swaram% cannot be 
 used consecutively.  An example is  <Saaranga> which uses both varieties of 
 ma. The higher variety (black note ^ma%) is used most of the time as its parent is   
 Kalyaani which uses the black note ma.  The lower variety is used only in the 
 phrase ri-ga-ma*- ri-sa.    Another Bhaashaanga Raagam <Bhairavi> uses lower 
 variety of ^da% in most phrases but uses higher variety in phrases in the ascent 
 (pa-da*-ni-Sa) and in the phrase Sa-ni-da*-ni-Sa.   In writing notation anya
 swarams are marked with an asterisk ' * '.   

 ^Janya% Raagams which are not  Bhaashaanga Raagams are known as ^Upaanga% 
 Raagams.  Janaka Raagams are also known as Raagaanga raagams and the
 term ^Melam% or ^Melakartha% is used to refer to the scale or choice of notes rather 
 than the Raagam, which is not a mere combination of notes but has many more
 attributes.~ 
 @Raagam Classification - Historical$

 Historically the classification of raagams based on the choice of notes and the 
 idea of grouping them under Melams is only about 6 centuries old.  Prior to 
 that raagams were described by the dominant note, the ending note and 
 occurrence of ^Vikritha% (changed) notes, as the notes of a particular scale were 
 described as pure or Suddha.  The idea of scales formed by using different 
 combinations (mixture - Milana -Mela) perhaps started with Vidhyaaranya (14th
 Century) and culminated with Venkatamakhi proposing 72 scales in his work 
 Chathurdandiprakaasika in the 17 the century (see Melam Module). 

 However, many of the ^Janaka% raagams were in use before the ^Melam% scheme.  
 The terms Janaka and ^Janya% do not imply that the Janya has origin in the 
 Janaka.  The scheme has to be taken more as a convenient and easy way to 
 remember which variety of ^ri%,^ga%,^ma%, ^da% and ^ni% is used in the raagam.  Some 
 Janya raagams which omit notes can be given parenthood in more than one 
 Janaka Raagam which differ in the omitted note.  Mohanam omits ^ma% and ^ni%
 and its notes are sa-ri-ga-pa-da-Sa (all white).   It can be put  under 4 different 
 melams which have these 5 notes, but differ in ma and ni.  In practice a Janaka
 raga having nearest Bhaava or mood is chosen as the parent but differences 
 persist in texts.  Mohanam is shown under Kalyaani or Harikaambodhi in 
 different texts.  You can see this <pictorially>~
 @ Notes - Names and positions$

 The symbols ^sa%,^ri%,^ga%,^ma%,^pa%,^da%,^ni% used for the notes are adapted from the first 
 letters of their full names ^Shadjam%, ^Rishabham%, ^Gaandhaaram%, ^Madhyamam%, 
 ^Panchamam%, ^Dhaivatham%, Nishaadham.  ^Shadjam% means that which gives  
 birth to six (notes).  'Madhyamam' means the middle, and 'Panchamam' the 5th.   
 To distinguish between the two varieties of ^ri%,^ga%,^ma%,^da% and ^ni%, adjectives are 
 used.  Thus the two ^ri%'s are ^Suddha Rishabham% and ^Chathusruthi Rishabham%, 
 the two ^ga%'s are ^Saadhaarana Gaandhaaram% and ^Anthara Gaandhaaram%, the  
 two ^ma%'s are ^Suddha Madhyamam% and ^Prathi Madhyamam%, the two ^da%'s are 
 ^Suddha Dhaivatham% and ^Chathusruthi Dhaivatham% and the two ^ni%'s are 
 ^Kaisiki Nishaadham% and ^Kaakali Nishaadham% (the first name in each case refers to 
 the note with the lower pitch). 

 In this package, for brevity the symbols ri1,ri2, ga1,ga2,ma1,ma2,da1,da2 and 
 ni1,ni2 are used. {These are not official symbols} but informally used in teaching 
 beginners (as "small ri and big ri" etc.).  In the more elaborate ^Melakartha% 
 scheme ri2,ga1,da2 and ni1 get one more set of names (explained in full in the
 Melam Module).   Symbols ri3,ga0,da3 and ni0 are used for these additional 
 names.  (Two <other symbol> systems are also used in the literature.)  You can 
 see the names of the notes (including the additional names) more clearly on a 
 <piano> keyboard picture taking C as ^sa%, or on the sketch of a <Veena>.~
 @ Raaga  Bhaavam - Gamakam$

 Raaga ^Bhaavam% or the mood that a ^Raagam% evokes depends on many factors. 
 The choice of notes, ^aarohanam% and ^avarohanam% provide the basics.  The 
 stress on certain notes, whether a note can be prolonged with or without 
 ^Gamakam%, the type of Gamakam used and characteristic phrases complete the 
 shape of a raagam. Two raagams like Sankaraabharanam and Kalyaani which 
 differ only in the note ^ma% can be distinguished even in phrases without ma
 because in Sankaraabharanam ^ri% and ^da% are almost always sung with Gamakam 
 and ^Ga% is always held straight while in Kalyaani ^ri% and ^da% can be held straight
 or sung with Gamakam and ^ga% often has a small range gamakam.  Listen to the 
 phrases in the range lower ^pA% to ^sa% (not touching ma), as sung in these two 
 raagams <Sankaraabharanam> and <Kalyaani>. 

 To appreciate the difference that Gamakam imparts to the music, listen to the 
 first line of the ^Krithi%  Thanayuni  in Bhairavi with plain notation 
 <without Gamakam> (hardly recognizable as Bhairavi) and the same line
 <with Gamakam > required for realising  the Raaga Bhaavam .  The notation 
 now used to write down Carnatic compositions does not use any symbols for
 gamakams, except  for occasional use of a wavy line over the note implying
 that the note is oscillated. Subbarama Dheekshithar used fifteen symbols for
 the different types of gamakams in his Sangeetha Sampradhaaya Pradharsini
 (as early as 1905) but even these are qualitative and do not describe the range
 or timings involved in the movements.~

@Gamakams - Names - Examples (1) $

 Gamakams are traditionally of 10 varieties ('Veena gaana dhasa gamakakriye' -
 ^Krithi% 'Meenaakshi me mudham' by Dheekshithar).  In Sangeetha Sampradhaaya
 Pradharsini, Subbarama Deekshithar lists 15 and explains them. He assigned 
 symbols to them which are used throughout this work.  Some of the descriptions
 are relevant only to the Veena.  The more important are described here:

 ^Kampitham% is the oscillation of a note.  The oscillation could be very short
 in range as in <Kalyani Ga>. (Only this type of gamakam is treated as Kampitham
 in Sampradaaya Pradarsini). In many cases the lower note (or an intermediate
 position) is used as the anchor and note is oscillated up to its own position or 
 over a range of 1, 2 or even 3 notes (such oscillaions touching other notes are 
 called 'Vali' in Sampradaaya Pradarsini). Such oscillations are common for ri1,
 ga1, ma2, da1 and ni1.  In the case of ma2 the upper note pa is usually the
 anchor. For ri1 and da1 usually short range Kampitham is used. Listen to
 <ri1 of Gowla>. Notes ga1 and ni1 may use both short and large range kampitham.
 Listen to <ga of Kaanada> using large range kampitham. Kampitham may also 
 be anchored on the higher pitch and oscillate downwards as in the note 
 <ni1 of Surati>.  ~

@Gamakams - Names - Examples (2) $

 ^Nokku%  or ^Thirupam% involves pulling of the ^Veena% string even while the note is
 reached thus touching the higher note first before coming to the actual note. 
 This could be in the ascent as in the case of <nokku on ga> of Maayaamaalava-
 gowla in the phrase sa-ri1-ga2 (^ma% is touched before ^ga% is reached) and
 on <da2 & ni2> of Sankaraabharanam in the phrase pa-da-ni-Sa (^ni% touched before
 ^da% and ^Sa% touched before ni). This gamakam also occurs in the starting note of 
 many ascending phrase such as ri2 of Sankarabharanam, ga1 of Aananda-
 bhairavi in <ga ma pa>, ni1 in  'ni sa Ree' of Bhairavi.  It is also used while turning 
 on the note as in <pa ma pa> of Bhairavi (the audio is 'pa ma pa da ni Saa'), ma
 being pulled from ga2 fret on Veena.  It is an extensively used gamakam - as
 common as Kampitham  

 ^Jaaru% is smooth slide from one note to another.  When it is an ascending slide
 it is <Etra Jaaru> and when descending it is <Erakku Jaaru>. In fact there is always
 continuity between notes in any single phrase (which is the characteristic of 
 Carnatic Music), but the term ^Jaaru% is used when the slide pronounced and 
 slower than usual ascent or descent between notes.  ~
 @Gamakams - Names - Examples (3) $

 ^Janta% is doubling a note with stress on the second note obtained by momentarily 
 touching a lower note (crushed note) as in the phrase <sa-sa-ri-ri-ga-ga-ma-ma> or
 <Sa-sa-ni-ni-da-da-pa-pa> in Maayaamaalavagowla. In ascent Janta is also called 
 ^Sphuritham% and in descent Prathyaaghaatham.  The lower note need not be 
 present in that ^Raagam% but the next lower note in the12 note scheme or an 
 intermediate point. The second note may also be 'akaara' i.e. without <strumming> 
 or changing <bow> movement on instruments.  Janta imparts 'Ghanam' to the
 music. Sometimes when the note is repeated an upper note's pitch may be
 heard momentarily (especially on the ^Veena%). 

 ^Khandippu% - When descending to a lower note over a large range, sometimes a
 very short break is given, and the lower note is reached starting from an 
 intermediate note. For instance in Sankaraabharanam, the notation 'Sa ni paa' 
 is played as Sa ni (da) paa with a very short break after ni and reaching paa 
 from da without stopping at da. Listen to <Sa ni- (da)- paa> (there is also a
 Janta on Pa) .  Similarly in the same raagam khandippu is applied in the
 phrase <ga ma pa - (ga) ri sa> at ga 

 ^Orikkai% is sliding down from one not to the another aftrer momentarily touching 
 the higher note. Orikkai is often used on all notes in a descending phrase as in  
 <pa ma ga ri> in Kalyaani  ~ 

 @Raagam - Identification - Swara Jnyaanam$

 How is a ^Raagam% recognized?  For the old raagams the '^Bhaavam%' or the
 mood helps in recognizing the raagam.  The mood can be grasped by listening 
 to standard compositions in the Raagam and remembering phrases covering 
 different ranges in the octaves.  However, in the case of many of the new 
 raagams including mela raagams which have evolved after the 72 ^Melam% 
 theory,  they often feel like mixture of well known raagams.   <Lathaangi> 
 could look like a mixture of  <Simhendhramadyamam> and <Kalyaani>.  In
 such cases a knowledge of the notes sung can help to recognize the raagam. 
 Identifying notes (called Swara Jnyaanam) is often difficult when extensive 
 ^Gamakam% is used but ability to recognize straight notes can be acquired easily 
 with some practice even by a rasika not having formal musical training. 

 Here  is a <Quiz> for testing your ability to recognize notes from the 12 notes in 
 an octave.  The simple nomenclature of 'ri1, ri2, ga1, ga2 etc. is used' as the 
 complex scheme where the same note like ri2 has also the name of ga0 is valid 
 only for scales.  You can also use the Raagam and Melam modules to acquire 
 Swara jnyaanam by listening to the ^aarohanam% and ^avarohanam% and (in the  
 Raagam module) the phrases whose notation is highlighted when each phrase
 is played.  The Melam module has a quiz for recognizing melams.~
@Musical Forms in Carnatic Music - Krithi$

 The ^Krithi% or composition - lyric set to a ^raagam% and ^thaalam% is the basis of 
 Carnatic Music.  The krithi is said to be an evolution of the ^keerthanai% or devo-
 tional songs which were simple in melodic structure, had a number of stanzas
 and emphasized devotion.  The krithi is more sophisticated and as evolved now
 has the ^Pallavi% (refrain), ^Anupallavi% (the second part developing on the theme
 set by the pallavi) and ^Charanam% (a larger part, usually starting at lower region
 of the octave). They have many '^sangathi%s' (repetitions with progressive varia-
 tions in melody).  In one form of krithi (most of Thyaagaraaja krithis) the second 
 half of the charanam has the same melodic structure as the anupallavi.  (Ex. 
 Enthanerchina in Suddha Dhanyaasi included in the samples of GAAYAKA) 

 Some krithis  have more than one charanam with identical melody and 
 occasionally with different melodic structures (ex. Paraasakthi Janani in
 Hamsadhwani by Paapanaasam Sivan).  Some krithis of Dheekshithar do not 
 have Anupallavi but only a 'Samashti Charanam' (ex. Mahaaganapathim in 
 Naata).  Dheekshithar's compositions in general do not follow a set melodic
 pattern; the charanams are large with unexpected melodic turns.  

 The krithis along with varnams have largely contributed to defining the raaga 
 lakshanam, as mere ^aarohanam% and ^avarohanam% cannot fully describe
 the finer nuances of a raagam.~
@Musical Forms - Raagamalika$

 In Carnatic Music the ^raagam% mood can be conveyed with a few characteristic
 phrases and this has enabled composing krithis in a succession of raagams -
 each Raagam for a few aavarthams or even for one aavartham.  In many raaga-
 maalikaas, ^chitta swaram%s are added for each Raagam and at the end, chitta-
 swarams are sung in the reverse order ('Viloma kramam') ending with the
 Raagam of pallavi.  In many raagamaalikaas, the name of the Raagam (raaga
 mudhra) is found in each of the stanzas.  Among the trinity Dheekshithar has
 composed raagamaalikaas (ex. Sri Viswanaatham in 14 raagams with Raagam
 changing in the middle of ^aavartham%).  Navaraagamaalika ^Varnam% (in 9 
 raagams) is a standard varnam taught to students.  Maha Vaidhyanaatha Iyer
 composed raaga thaala maalikaa in the 72 melakarthaa raagams and with
 variation in ^thaalam% also. In recent times Swaathi Thirunaal's 'Bhaavayaami' is
 sung as raagamaalikaa.  'Sri Chakraraaja' is an example of Raagamaalika 
 without chittaswarams

 Apart from compositions set as Raagamalikaas by the composer himself, it is
 also customary to sing Sanskrit Slokams and Thamizh 'Viruthams' as raaga-
 maalikaas at the end of a concert.  Some of Subramanya Bharathiar's songs
 have also be set as Raagamaalikaas.~
@Musical Forms - Aalaapana and Kalpana Swaram$
 The ^Aalaapana% is an example of a musical form giving scope for improvisation
 within a framework.  It is not totally unstructured or a mere combination of 
 random notes of the ^raagam%, but an emotionally satisfying development of the
 raagam mood within its definitions but giving scope for creativity.  The
 Aalaapana does not have a rhythmic pattern, but there is an inherent time sense
 in the phrases.  It could take as little as a minute or two or could be expanded
 to cover even an hour!  When made elaborate, aalaapana is usually structured
 starting at the lower pitches and progressively touching higher pitches and
 finally covering some quick phrases.  In older schools, the aalaapana was 
 supposed to stress more on the melodic aspects of the ^Krithi% to follow and a full 
 exposition of the raagam was reserved to Raagam, Thaanam, Pallavi.   

 ^Kalpana Swaram% is the extempore singing of solfa (sa ri ga ma etc.) at the
 end of a ^krithi% or in the middle, taking either the ^pallavi% or other line as a
 refrain.  Rhythmic pattern is the main highlight of kalpana swaram.  Each group
 has to end correctly at the point in the ^thaalam% cycle where the refrain starts.  
 Starting with groups of swarams covering one or two aavarthams,  the artiste 
 goes on to larger number of aavarthams often using clever rhythmic patterns 
 at the end of each group before repeating the refrain.  The "iruthi makutam" or 
 last group of phrases usually a combination of groups of odd number of notes 
 repeated thrice to correctly coincide with the start of the refrain, has now 
 become a standard practice.~
@Musical Forms- Thaanam, Pallavi$

 ^Thaanam% is the extempore elaboration of the raagam mood to stress the 
 ghana aspect using the syllables "a, tha, nom, tham". (Historically the term
 had a different meaning implying skipping of notes.) There is inherent rhythm
 in thaanam and sometimes artistes have mridhangam accompany the Thaanam
 though it is not set to any ^thaalam% in particular.  One of the definitions of a
 "ghana" raagam is a raagam which is well suited for thaanam.  The present
 Thaanam form perhaps developed on the ^Veena% which is very suited for it and
 Thaanam is often played on the Veena after ^aalaapana% before a ^krithi% but 
 vocalists generally reserve it to "raagam, thaanam, pallavi".  Some 'chittai' 
 thaanam's (ready made) are available in the ghana panchaka raagams.

 Pallavi is the form where instead of a krithi a single line of lyric covering one
 aavartham (or more if chaapu thaalam is chosen) in 2 ^kalai% or even 4 kalai
 is taken up for elaboration with great emphasis on the rhythmic aspect.  The 
 line could be the ^pallavi% of a well known song (but could be in a different 
 thaalam).  Usually sung after aalaapana and thaanam, the pallavi is elaborated 
 in different kaalams including a ^thisra% ^nadai% in which 3 cycles of the pallavi
 cover 2 aavarthams.  ^Kalpana swaram% invariably follows the pallavi and often 
 the swarams are sung in other raagams returning to the main raagam at the 
 end.  In days of 3 or 4 hour concerts raagam, thaanam, pallavi was always 
 included in the concert.  ~
 @Musical Forms - Varnams$

 The student of Carnatic Music starts with ^Sarali Varisai% (solfa in different tempos)
 ^Janta% varisai (solfa of paired notes), Dhaattu varisai (note practice with jumps),
 ^Alankaaram% (solfa in different thaalams), ^Geetham% (simple songs without 
 sangathis or difficult phrases) and then goes on to Varnams.  Varnams are said 
 to epitomize the grammar of the ^raagam% (raaga lakshanam).  Varnams are of 2 
 types, the thaana varnam and the padha varnam.  The thaana varnam consists 
 of a ^pallavi%,  ^anupallavi% followed by "mukthaayi swaram" and then by a single 
 ^aavartham% of ^charanam% again followed by 3 to 6 ^chitta swaram%  groups,  with 
 increasing number of aavarthams.  The lyric of varnam is sparse in words and 
 gives training to the voice in "akaara" or melody without consonants.  Concerts
 are often started with a varnam.  Little is  known of the origin of the word 
 'thaana varnam' but one school has it that the note groups (usually threes, twos 
 and fives) are like ^thaanam% singing and this is stressed when varnam is played 
 on the Veena.

 The padha varnam is meant for dance but is also sung in concerts (ex.'Nee 
 indha maayam' in Dhanyaasi).  It has a structure similar to the thaana varnam 
 but words of lyric are also available for the mukthaayi and chitta swarams.  The
 single line of the charanam often gives considerable scope to the Bharatha- 
 naatyam dancer to portray a number of legends associated with the main deity 
 on whom the varnam is composed.~
@Musical Forms - Swara Jathi, Thillaana, Padham, Jaavali$

 Though the term "jathi" would imply the use of rhythmic mnemonics used in
 dance like 'tha thi thai thom' etc. Swarajathi as sung now a days do not use
 these jathis but consist of a ^pallavi%, ^anupallavi% and a number of charanams
 in which the the swarams (solfa) are first sung followed by the lyric.  Swara-
 jathis of Syaama Saasthri in Bhairavi and Thodi are well known.  Simpler
 swarajathis in Bilahari and Aanandhabhairavi are usually taught to students 
 before teaching varnams.

 ^Thillaana% is a lively form of composition making extensive use of the dance
 mnemonics.  The compositions are a mixture of these jathis, lyrics and swarams.
 Essentially composed for use in Bharatha natyam, thillaanas are also very
 popular in musical concerts, the jathis providing scope for complex rhythmic
 patterns.

 Padhams were originally simple devotional songs, but with the adoption of
 padhams extensively for dance later compositions included the 'Naayaki -
 Naayaka' concept of devotion with romantic passages.  Jaavalis are explicitly
 romantic and also used for dance.  Padhams (especially those of Khsethrayya)
 are sung both in ghana raagams like Thodi and ^rakthi% raagams like Sahaana.
 Jaavalis are generally set to rakthi raagams.~
