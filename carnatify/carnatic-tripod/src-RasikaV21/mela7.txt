
                                 @Melam Scheme - Introduction$                                 

 The  present  accepted  scheme of classification of Raagams in Carnatic Music 
 is based on the 'Melam' scheme  -  or a scheme of combination of notes . The 
 word 'mela' literally means 'union' as the scales are arrived at by selection
 and union of different sets of  7 notes from the possible 12 notes in an octave. 
 The 12 notes are the seven white notes and 5 black notes in an octave on any 
 <keyboard> instrument or the 12 frets between octaves in a fretted stringed
 instrument like the <Veena>.  Earlier theorists tried to classify raagams based 
 on factors like starting note(^Graha%), dominant(^Amsa%), ending note(^Nyaasa%) and 
 the occurrence of 'intermediate' notes(Anthara or Saadhaarana) in the 'pure' 
 scale. 

 The idea of classifying raagams based on selection of 7 notes from the 
 possible array of notes perhaps started with Vidhyaaranya in the 14th century 
 and  culminated in the present accepted theory by Venkatamakhi (17th century), 
 in his work 'Chathurdhandiprakaasika'.  Under this scheme 72 scales or {'Melams'} 
 are postulated.   Some ancient Tamil works used the 12 constellations to   
 represent note positions and chose 7 positions from them and it would appear 
 that the approach to classification based on 12 notes has its origin in South 
 India.~
@Building Melams - a simple scheme$

 The Carnatic Music system uses the symbols ^sa%,^ri%,^ga%,^ma%,^pa%,^da%,^ni% for the seven 
 notes corresponding to western C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C.  The symbols ri,ga,ma,da and 
 ni actually denote 2 note positions each, leading to 12 note positions.   Melams 
 are built by choosing 7 of the possible 12 notes with some restrictions and all 
 raagams are grouped under the melams.  The South Indian system stipulates  
 that the fifth or ^pa% (G) is to be always  included in every Melam apart from ^sa%(C) 
 the tonic and these 2 notes have to be present in every Melam.  (^Janya% raagams 
 or raagams 'born'  from the various melams can however omit any note  
 including the fifth note ^pa% but not the tonic ^sa%). 

 A simple informal system allows two variations for each of the remaining 5
 notes i.e., ri, ga, ma da and ni -  either the black or white note in each of the
 pairs of ri, ga, ma, da, ni.  (The two variations are informally referred to as
 'big' and 'small' when teaching beginners.) This would lead to 32 melams in
 all  because 2 multiplied by itself 5 times would give 32.  (In fact the North
 Indian classical music system uses only  2 variations each for the 5 notes.)  But 
 this would not be adequate to describe and classify some raagams prevalent
 in the south, in which apparently both the variations of the same note occurred 
 -raagams  such as Varaali and  Naata.  Venkatamakhi's theory accommodates 
 them and proposes 72 combinations. ~
 @Venkatamakhi's Scheme$
 Two variations are permitted for ^ma% corresponding to F and  F#. These are not 
 allowed to occur simultaneously in any melam.  As ^sa% and ^pa% have to be used
 in all melams, this leaves 4 notes ^ri%, ^ga%, ^da% and ^ni% for further selections.  In the 
 12 notes scheme this actually means that 8 positions are available,  4 between 
 ^sa% and ^ma%  (2 ^ri%'s and 2 ^ga%'s or D flat, D, E flat and E) and 4  between ^pa% and 
 upper ^sa% (2 ^da%'s  and 2 ^ni%'s or A flat, A,  B flat and B).  

             



 

 Venkatamakhi chose 2 notes each from each of the groups of 4 notes.  Of  the 2 
 notes chosen between sa and ma (i.e.  chosen  from Db,D,Eb,E) the lower is 
 called ri and the higher ga.  This implies that the second note position from
 sa (D) is called ga when it occurs with lower ri(D flat-the first note after sa) and 
 the third note position from sa (E flat) is called ri when it occurs with ga(E - 4th
 note from sa).   Similarly 2 notes are chosen from the possible 4 notes between 
 pa and Sa of upper octave (G and C) and the lower called da and higher ni. 
 6 selections are possible in each of the two groups (mathematically 4 C 2 i.e  
 (4 x 3)/2 = 6).~
@  Venkatamakhi's scheme- Selection of ri, ga da and ni$

The 6 possible selections of ^ri% and ^ga% are illustrated below:
                       (^sa%)     x        x        x        x     (^ma%)
   Choice No
       < 1 >                       ri       ga                                      (click on the number  
       < 2 >                       ri                 ga                             to hear sa-ri-ga-ma)
       < 3 >                       ri                           ga
       < 4 >                                 ri       ga
       < 5 >                                 ri                 ga
       < 6 >                                           ri       ga 

The 6 selections for ^da% and ^ni% are:
                      (^pa%)      x        x         x         x     (^Sa%)
   Choice No
       < 1 >                       da      ni                                      (click on the number
       < 2 >                       da                 ni                            to hear pa-da-ni-Sa)
       < 3 >                       da                           ni
       < 4 >                                 da       ni
       < 5 >                                 da                 ni   
       < 6 >                                            da      ni 
~
@The magic Number 72$

 For each selection of pair of ^ri% and ^ga% there are 6 possible selections of ^da% and 
 ^ni% and thus there are 6 x 6 =  36  possible selections of ^ri%,^ga%,^da% and ni.  Since 
 ^ma% is allowed 2 variations, for each of these 36 combinations we get 2 varia-
 tions leading  to  36 x 2 = 72 melams.   We get 40 more than what was possible
 if ^ri%,^ga%,^da% and ^ni% could each have only 2 variations, because in each of the 6 
 selections
                           (^sa%)    ri1     ri2     ga1      ga2   (^ma%)
         *1                        {ri       ga}
          2                          ri                 ga
          3                          ri                              ga
          4                                    ri       ga
          5                                    ri                    ga
         *6                                             {ri          ga }  
 the first and the sixth would not have been possible in the simple scheme and
 so we could get only 4 X 4 or 16 selections of  ri,ga,da and ni and with 2 ma's 
 we had only 32.    Melams which have  these additional selections are called 
 '^Vivaadhi%' melams borrowing the historical term 'Vivaadhi' which means 
 dissonant.  Examples of these Vivaadhi melams are Chalanaata, Jhaalavaraali,
 Gaanamoorthi, Vaagadheeswari  .~
 @Names for the notes$
 Notes at some positions have double names .  Counting ^sa% as 1, notes at
 positions 3 & 4 can be either ^ri% or ^ga% and notes at 9 & 10 can be either ^da% or ni. 
 The lower of the two notes chosen after ^sa% is named ^ri% and the higher ga.  
 Similarly the lower of the two notes after ^pa% is named ^da% and the higher ni.   
 The notes have also special names derived from the historical Sruthi system   
 which conceived of 22 sruthis in an octave. The graphic below shows the 
 names with reference to the six choices between ^sa% and ^ma% and between ^pa% 
 and Sa.












 You can also see the names on the picture of a <Veena> or <Keyboard>.~


@Note names - Historical $ 

 Although the basic scheme of melams that we use today was conceived 
 by Venkatamakhi, the names we use for the notes (as given in the previous
 page) are different in some cases.  Venkatamakhi put ^Suddha Gaandhaaram%
 and ^Suddha Nishaadham%, 5 ^sruthi%s from the sa and pa to be in line
 with the sruthi values of these notes as mentioned in ancient texts. When the
 same positions are used for ^Rishabham%  (ri2) and ^Dhaivatham% (da2),
 Venkatamakhi called them 'Panchasruthi Rishabham' and 'Panchasruthi
 Dhaivatham'.  The present use of 'Chathusruthi' for these notes is ascribed
 to Govindaachaarya (Sangraha Choodaamani - 18th century) who made many 
 changes in the sruthi positions of notes, dropping the traditional values.

 Venkatamakhi used the name 'Varaali Madhyama' for ma2, perhaps to avoid
 confusion with a variety of other names used in his time. The term 
 '^Prathi Madhyamam%' that we use today is also ascribed Govinda.  (See the
 topic "I. Names for Melams" which explains how most of the melam names
 used by Venkatamakhi are different from those used today).~

 @Finding the notes of a Melam$

 The melams are grouped into 12 tables of six each and numbered to enable  
 the notes occurring in a Melam to be worked out from the number.  The 12  
 tables are broadly divided into two groups. The first 6 tables  with 36 melams
 use ^Suddha Madhyamam% (ma1 or F) and the next 6 tables with 36 melams use 
 ^Prathi Madhyamam% (ma2 or F#). Except for this difference table no.1 is identical 
 with table no.7 and so on. Melams differing by 36 in the serial number have all 
 notes identical except for ma.   In each table of six melams the selection  of ^ri% 
 and ^ga% are the same throughout the table.  Thus the first six tables represent   
 the six possible combinations of ^ri% and ^ga% and  Suddha Madhyamam and   
 the next six tables with Prathi Madhyamam.

 Inside each table the selection of ^da% and ^ni% varies. There are  thus six melams
 in each table to provide for the possible six combinations of ^da% and ni.  The 
 tables are known as 'Chakrams' and have names associated with the number 
 (such as Vedha chakram for the 4th table - there are 4 Vedhaas) To get the table 
 number and position of a Melam number N,  divide N-1  by 6.  Add 1 to the  
 quotient to get the table number: add 1 to the remainder to get the position of 
 the Melam in the table.  You can see a  <pictorial> demo. of the selection of 
 notes for a Melam and also hear the notes.~
 @Names for the Melams$

 Venkatamakhi did not distinguish between the ^Raagam% and the Melam. He 
 chose the most prominent Raagam with the notes and named the Melam after it.
 His mela raagams could have ^Vakra% ascent or descent and could omit some 
 notes in either ascent or descent. He named Melam 22 (now Kharaharapriya)
 as Sri Raaga Melam and Melam 8 (now Hanumatthodi) as Bhoopaala melam.  In
 fact he describes only 19 melams (one being his own invention) and says that
 his scheme would enable future compositions in new melams ( which did 
 materialize -  leading to raagams like Shanmukhapriya). Subsequently names
 were given for all the 72 melams. In Venkatamakhi school which is followed 
 by Muthuswaamy Dheekshithar and Subbaraama Dheekshithar, these were
 called Kanakaambari etc. and continued to have ^Vakra% or ^Varjya% (omissions)
 notes in the definition itself.  A further refinement came when the melams
 were considered as scales as distinct from the raagams.  The ^Raagam% having
 all the 7 notes and no ^Vakra% ascent or descent was called the ^Melakartha%
 raagam.  In this scheme new names were given starting with Kanakaangi.  In
 either scheme the names were so assigned that from the first two letters of the
 name written in Sanskrit the number could be worked out.  For some melams
 like Kalyaani, Sankaraabharanam, Thodi this made it necessary to add
 prefixes.  Kalyaani became Mechakalyaani, Sankaraabharanam got Dheera
 as prefix.  Thodi became Hanumatthodi. ~
 @ Melam Names, 72 Melams - Audio-visual,  Melam Chart$

 The mnemonic system for working out the number of a Melam from its name is  
 called the 'Katapayaadhi Sankhya'. The first 9 consonants of Sanskrit alphabet   
 ka, kha, ga, gha, nga, cha, chha, ja, jhha, denote digits 1 to 9 and jnya denotes 
 0.  Similarly numbers are associated with the 10 consonants starting from 'ta', 5 
 consonants from 'pa' and the 8 consonants from 'ya'.  The number of the Melam 
 is obtained by taking the digits corresponding to the first two letters and then 
 reversing the number. (Ex.) Keeravani. - ka is 1 and ra is 2 (in ya ra la va..). So 
 it is the 21st melam.    

 You can get a list of the 72 melams in <alphabetical> order or in <numerical> 
 order and also get the same Audio-visual as seen earlier but with the option of  
 hearing the notes with or without gamakam.  A word of caution - the gamakams 
 are relevant only to the ^Raagam% and not the Melam and even in a Raagam on 
 the same note different gamakams may be used according to the situation.   
 What is illustrated in the audio-visual is the more common ^gamakam% used for 
 the note in the principal Raagam of the melam.

 You can also see a <chart> of all the 72 melams showing the notes used (the
 symbols used in the chart are the same as in this package i.e. ga0,ga1,ga2 and
 ni0,ni1,ni2 for ^ga% and ^ni%). <Cllick> to see a list of Mela names of 'Kankambari'

 @Sruthi Bhedham or Graha Bhedham$

 The concept of Tonic is essential for the development of idea of musical scales  
 and raagams.  In Carnatic Music the tonic is always ^sa% and other notes related  
 to it.   Since the pitch of the tonic can be chosen by the musician according to    
 his convenience, the same set of notes can lead to a different scale if the tonic  
 is changed to one of the notes in the scale.  The understanding of this process  
 becomes easier if we presume that the musical scale is equally tempered    
 i.e., the pitch separation between any 2 consecutive notes in the 12 notes in   
 an octave is the same.   To get a 7 note scale or Melam we choose 7 of the 12   
 notes with certain restrictions.  Thus Dheerasankaraabharanam (29th Melam)    
 uses the 2nd, 4th,5th  7th, 9th and 11th notes and can be represented as  
            sa * ri * ga ma * pa * da * ni (Sa * Ri * Ga Ma ....)  
 the * representing note not used.   Suppose we now change the tonic to the  
 pitch of ^ri% but play the same notes from ri  to  Ri on an instrument like ^Veena%
 or keyboard  we will hear the notes  x * x x * x * x * x x * x  or the 2nd, 3rd, 5th,
 7th,9th and the 10th notes starting from the old ri.  As ri is now the tonic we call 
 it sa and we will get the notes  sa * ri ga * ma * pa * da ni * Sa
 or sa ri2 ga1 ma1 pa da2 ni1 sa which is the Kharaharapriya (22nd) melam.~
 @Sruthi Bhedham (2)$

 Essentially the Melam is obtained by choosing 7 of the 12 notes or by leaving 
 gaps in the 12 notes.  Since only 5 notes are dropped there are always pairs 
 without gaps.  By shifting the tonic we change the position of the gaps and thus
 get another melam.  Sometimes the Melam so obtained may not be permissible. 
 For instance if we make ^ni% of Sankaraabharanam as the new tonic we get a 
 Melam without ^pa% but with both the madhyamams.





 The term ^Graha% is used to indicate the starting note, in this case ^sa% which is the
 tonic.  As we change the starting note there is Graha Bhedham.  As we change
 the tonic it is also ^Sruthi% Bhedham as the tonic is provided by the ^Thamboora%
 sruthi.   Listen to the notes of <Dheerasankaraabharana> Melam with ^sa% at 1 
 ^Kattai% or C of the keyboard, with the background Sruthi of 1 kattai.  Listen to the 
 same notes  starting with <ri2 (D)> and ending with ri2 with Sruthi of 2 Kattai 
 giving Kharaharapriya Melam and starting with <ga2 (E)> and ending with ga2  
 with the Sruthi of 3 Kattai giving Hanumatthodi Melam.~
 @Sruthi Bhedham (3)$

 ^Sruthi% Bhedham  can be applied to ^Janya% raagams also.  For instance,
 <Mohanam> will give <Hindholam> if we make ga2 of Mohanam the tonic.



 Obviously if note ^da% of Hindholam is made the tonic we get Mohanam.  From
 Mohanam we can get the 4 raagams Madhyamaavathi, Hindholam, Suddha-
 Saaveri and Suddhadhanyaasi by starting with ^ri%,^ga%,^pa% and ^da% respectively.
 In practice however, we rarely hear Hindholam when Mohanam is sung even
 without a Thamboora.  This is mainly due to gamakams.  Note ^pa% of Mohanam
 is to be held straight while corresponding note ^ga% in Hindholam is held with
 ^Gamakam% reaching to ma.  ^Graha% bhedham of Sankaraabharanam with ^ri% as
 tonic gives Kharaharapriya but ^ri% of Sankaraabharanam is rarely held without
 Gamakam while corresponding note ^sa% in Kharaharapriya is the tonic and is
 to be held straight.   The practical use of Graha Bhedham is historical and
 related to days when harps with separate strings were used and it was easier
 to change the mode by changing the tonic.  It has very little practical use in
 present day Carnatic Music, though occasionally a musician tries with much
 effort to produce the shade of another ^Raagam% by changing the gamakams and 
 stressing the note for the new tonic.   But the difficulty only goes to stress the 
 importance of gamakams in Carnatic Music for realization of Raaga Bhaavam.~
 @Sruthi Bhedham - Audio Visual Demo.$

 For an audio-visual <demonstration> of the ^Sruthi% bhedham on different melams
 or raagam scales click the link above. In the new window the Melams menu lists
 the 72 melams in alphabetical order.  Select a Melam for a visual representation
 of the notes. Click on any note to see the new scale produced by using that note
 as tonic. The ^Janya%Raagams (1) menu lists {some} Janya raagams having the
 same notes in ^Aarohanam% and ^Avarohanam%.   JanyaRaagams (2) menu lists  
 {some} Janya raagams with different notes in Aarohanam and Avarohanam. Both
 the lists have only raagams without ^vakra% phrases and which are not  
 ^bhaashaanga raagam%s (except for Kaambodhi and Bilahari where the  
 anyaswarams have been omitted). The Janya Raagam lists are very limited.

 When the new note to be made ^sa% is clicked you will see the arrangement of
 notes in the new scale below the original scale. A message box appears giving 
 the name of the new Melam (if permissible) or giving reasons why the Melam
 is not permissible.  In the case of ^Janya% raagams (very limited lists) the name 
 of the new ^Raagam%  is given only if it is in the list.   For instance by making  
 ^ri% of  Hamsadhwani as the tonic we get a Raagam with ^sa% ri2 ma1 da2 ni1.  
 There is no common Raagam with this Aarohanam and Avarohanam. As no such
 ragam is in the list you get the appropriate message. To listen to the original 
 scale and the new scale click the buttons at the bottom of the screen.  For the
 new scale, the background sruthi will change to align to the new sa chosen.~

 @Keyboard Transpose Chart for Different Melams $

 If keyboard is used for playing music, for the same raga, the choice of black
 and white notes will vary according to the Aadhara ^Sruthi% chosen.  The
 keyboard charts provided in the Audio-visuals earlier take C as ^sa% and can
 be used for Aadhara Sruthi of 1 Kattai. For other Aadhara Sruthis you can
 use the keyboard chart generator in this page.  <Click here> for the interactive
 screen where you can select the required Melam by clicking the 'Select   
 Melam' command button.  You  can then click on the required white or black
 key corresponding to the Aadhara Sruthi required, which is mentioned below
 the white keys and above the black keys. (Initially the note positions for 
 Dheerasankaraabharanam - Melam 29 at 1 ^Kattai% Sruthiare shown).  The range
 1 Kattai to 8 Kattai is provided.  8 Kattai is same as 1 kattai. For other
 ranges add or subtract 7 from the number to bring it within the range of 1 to 8.
 The term 'half Kattai' is loosely used - generally to mean the black note below
 the  white note  below ^sa% (i.e nI1). For this note use 6.5 kattai. For the note
 just below sa (often referred to as 'mukkaal' or 3/4 Kattai) use 7 kattai.

 By clicking the Play button you can also hear the notes.~
