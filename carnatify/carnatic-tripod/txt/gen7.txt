                                                @Sound - Basics$

 By sound we normally mean the sensation produced in our ears.  Physically 
 sound is produced by the vibration of objects like the vocal chords, stretched 
 string of the ^Veena%, the air column of the flute, the reed in the harmonium or 
 simply the quick vibration of any object when it is struck. The vibrations have to 
 reach the ear through a medium, usually the air. The air molecules surrounding 
 the object producing the sound vibrate and the vibrations spread out in the form 
 of 'waves'  (by which we mean a disturbance moving through a medium while
 the medium itself undergoes only a to and fro movement at every point).  When 
 the wave reaches the ear, the ear drum vibrates in a manner similar to the 
 original object and the vibrations are conveyed to the inner ear where, fine
 hair follicle like objects vibrate and convey the sensation to the brain through
 nerves.   When objects vibrate at frequencies higher than or lower than what we
 can hear they are referred to as ultrasonic and subsonic sound.  Some animals
 (dogs especially) are sensitive to high frequency sounds.

 Three essential qualities of any sound- in particular musical sound are pitch,
 loudness and quality. These are the sensations produced in the person hearing
 the sound. They have their physical equivalents in frequency, intensity and 
 harmonic content which are quantities that can be measured.~
                                            @Pitch - Frequency$
                        
 Frequency is the number of times the original object (string or air column) or   
 the eardrum vibrates (makes a complete to and fro motion) every  second.  The 
 higher the frequency the higher is the pitch.  In music the pitch is usually
 referred to by the note name like ^sa%, ^ri%, C,D etc. but when discussing as a
 physical  entity the frequency number is taken as referring to the pitch.  Pitch
 is actually the sensation felt by the listener.  Extraneous factors can make the
 pitch of two sounds of the same frequency appear different.  Human ears are
 sensitive to the frequency range from 30 cycles per sec to 15000 cycles per
 second - the sensitivity to higher frequency falling at old age.  Most of the
 sounds we hear are usually well below 3000 cycles but the presence of higher
 frequency  harmonics affects the quality (see later).  To appreciate how sounds
 of different  frequencies feel, you can change the frequency in the box below
 by moving the scroll bar and then clicking on the 'Play' button.~
                                           @Loudness - Intensity$

 Loudness is a term well understood.  Its physical equivalent is the intensity
 of the sound which can be measured by the energy it contains or more simply
 by the amplitude of the vibration (ex. the extent to which the ^Veena% string is dis-
 placed from its normal position).  When sound is recorded digitally into a  .wav
 or similar file the extent to which the numbers deviate from the zero (no sound) 
 position decides the loudness.   Below are the graphs drawn from part of a 
 digital data of a violin sound at 2 levels of  loudness.  You can click on them to 
 hear the sounds. (The graphs shown cover only about 1.3% of the duration of
 the total sound you hear.)  ~
                                    @Quality or timbre - Harmonics$

 Quality is a term more difficult to define.   We speak of dull tone, rich tone,
 good voice or the good timbre of a musical instrument.  We also recognize
 consonants and vowels though spoken in different pitches.
 
 When the string of a musical instrument vibrates it does not make a simple
 oscillation with both ends fixed and the center making maximum movement.
 Actually the string can also vibrate in many different modes.   It can vibrate as
 if it consists of 2, 3, 4 or higher integral number of segments with the points at 
 midway, one third and two-thirds or every quarter of the length not moving at 
 all.  These points are called Nodes. You can see these movements by clicking 
 on the buttons opposite the boxes below. (Click 'Stop' to try a different mode) ~
                                   @Quality - Harmonics (continued)$

 The frequency of a vibrating string depends on the weight per unit length , how 
 tightly it is stretched (tension) and how long the vibrating part is.   Other things 
 being equal, the frequency is inversely proportional to the vibrating length i.e.
 if the length is half, the frequency is double.  So when a string vibrates in 2 
 segments it produces double the frequency, in 3 segments, three times the 
 frequency and so on.   These higher frequencies are called harmonics or over-
 tones.   A string can at the same time vibrate in all these modes and produce a 
 mixture of frequencies which are whole number of times the frequency of the 
 full string, which is called fundamental.  The relative strengths of these different
 modes can also vary widely and we have thousands of possible combinations, 
 which explains the wide variety tones from different musical instruments.  What 
 is true of strings is also true of air columns, stretched membranes, vocal chords 
 and almost any object producing sound.  In general a flute or whistle like sound 
 has less harmonics while stringed instruments are rich in harmonics.   In the 
 case of vibrating membranes (on drums) the harmonics may not be exact 
 multiples of the basic frequency.   In fact one of the important requirements of 
 sustained musical note is that its harmonics should be 'true' or whole multiples 
 of  the fundamental.  You can listen to 3 notes each on <plucked string> and on 
 <bowed string> with progressively greater proportion of higher harmonics. Less 
 harmonics implies a 'dull' tone, more implies 'brilliance' but too much may  be 
 'metallic' or 'nasal'. ~
                                             @ Pitch - Musical Notes$

 Of the 3 attributes of sound, it is pitch that has been given maximum importance 
 in musical theory .  A musical note can be defined as a sound where the pitch
 is constant for some period (say at least one twentieth of a second - but 
 generally much longer).  When there is a certain relationship among the pitches 
 of notes they sound pleasant when heard in succession (melody) or heard 
 together (harmony).  It is found that when two notes whose frequencies are in 
 simple ratios are heard  together or in succession they are pleasant.  The 
 simplest ratio of  2 (one note being twice in frequency of the other) gives 
 maximum blending when heard together and pleasant when heard one after
 the other.   Listen to two notes with frequencies in the ratio 1 : 2, first heard
 <in succession> and then <sounded together>.  For this reason same symbols are
 used  for notes whose frequencies are in the ratio 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 etc.  with suitable 
 indications.  The interval between a note and another with twice its frequency
 is called an octave because in most musical systems 7 notes are used before 
 reaching the 8th note with double the frequency.  The next best blending  is
 where one note is 1.5 times in frequency of the other note.  Listen to such a
 pair of notes in the ratio 2: 3, <in succession> and <together>.  2:3 is the inverse of 
 3:2 and since a note of double frequency blends completely notes with frequen-
 cies in the ratio 3:4 also blend as well as the notes of the ratio 2:3.  Also listen to 
 notes which are <not in simple ratio> - not very pleasant.~
                                       @Musical Notes - Frequencies$

 When a note of frequency (say) 400 is sung or played on a musical instrument
 it also has the harmonics with frequencies  800, 1200, 1600 etc.  When another 
 note with 1.5 times the frequency of 400 i.e. 600 is played we also hear the
 harmonics of 1200, 1800, etc. The common figure 1200 in these two notes makes 
 them blend well.   The ratio 1:2 blends thoroughly because the second note is 
 the 2nd harmonic of the first note.   When the ratio becomes smaller (say)  9:8 
 the blending is less as we have to hear the 10th harmonic (9 times) the first and 
 9th harmonic (8 times) the second (for the base of 400, the second note will be 
 450 and the harmonics 9 X 400 = 3600 and 8 X 450 = 3600). Generally very high 
 harmonics are weak.  But we can find another note i.e. with frequency 600 (1.5 
 times 400) which blends with both since 600 = 400 X 1.5 and 600 = 450 X 4/3.  
 <Listen> to the notes in the frequencies 400, 600, 450 and 600 again.

 The ratio 1.5 or 3:2 plays an important part in musical theory.  In Indian Music it 
 is called Samvaadhithva and ancient Tamil texts describe generation of scales
 using this ratio.  This process is called the 'cycle of fifths'.  If we take any note as 
 ^sa% then the note which is 1.5 times in frequency is ^pa% (in western notation C and 
 G).  ^Pa% is the 5th note in sa-ri-ga-ma-pa and hence the term cycle of fifths.  We 
 can calculate the frequencies of a number of musical notes by repeated multipli-
 cation by 1.5 and dividing by 2 whenever the frequency goes above twice the 
 frequency of ^sa% so that we get a note within the octave.~
                                        @Notes - Frequencies (2)$
 In melodic music the actual frequency is less important than the ratio between 
 the frequencies.  In Carnatic Music the musician is at liberty to chose any 
 frequency as his tonic and then it becomes sa. In discussing frequencies of 
 notes we use  'Relative Frequency' (r.f.) which is a ratio rather than the actual 
 frequencies. Thus ^pa% has the r.f of 3/2 or 1.5 which means that the actual 
 frequency of ^pa% will be 1.5 times the frequency of Sa. By applying cycle of fifths 
 5 times we can get  the following frequencies:  1 (the tonic), 3/2 (^pa%),  9/8 which
 is 3/2 X 3/2 = 9/4  divided by 2,  27/16 (9/8 X 3/2) and 81/64 (27/16 X 3/2 /2).  These
 are roughly the white notes ^sa%, ^pa%, ri2, da2 and ga2. Arranging in ascending 
 order ^sa%,ri2,ga2,^pa%,da2 and adding upper ^Sa% the r.f's are 1, 9/8, 81/64, 3/2, 27/16 
 and 2.  <Listen>  to these notes (you can perhaps recognize Mohanam). 
 Continuing, we get 243/128 (ni2) and taking 4/3 as ma1 we get all the white
 notes (not exactly, as on the keyboard which uses equally tempered scale - 
 explained later). To avoid more unwieldy figures we can use 15/8 instead of 
 243/128; these are very close (differ only by 81/80) and go further to get more 
 notes (black notes ma2,ri1,etc.)

 We can also calculate frequencies by multiplying by 4/3 instead of 1.5 (cycle of 
 fourths as 4/3 represents the fourth note from ^sa%). Trying the cycle of fourths we 
 get the ratios 1, 4/3 (ma1), 16/9 (4/3 X 4/3 ni1), 32/27 (16/9 X 4/3  /2  ga1) and
 128/81 (32/27 X 4/3  da1)  or 1, 32/27, 4/3, 128/81, 16/9 and 2 in ascending order.
 <Listen> to these notes.  (Can you  recognize Hindholam ?).~
                                     @Cycle of fifths and fourths$

 The diagrams below will help identify the notes in the cycle of fifths and fourths. 
 On a keyboard or fretted instrument there are 12 notes in the octave and ^pa% is
 at the 7th position and ma1 is at the 5th position.  So, to apply the cycle of fifths
 we count 7 notes up each time (counting all the notes - black and white)  and if 
 the result is above the upper ^Sa% we come back by 12 notes to be within the 
 octave.  On a cyclic diagram this is automatically done.  For cycle of fourths  
 count 5 notes each time. (Colors of the lettering correspond to key colors.) ~
                              @Cycle of fifths and fourths - problems$
 There is a catch in calculating frequencies by cycles using 3/2 and 4/3 as ratios 
 because 3/2 multiplied 12 times is 129.746.. and dividing by 2 repeatedly to
 come back to the octave we land up at 2.027.. instead of 2 which should be the
 r.f. of upper Sa.  In fact the ^pa% arrived at by cycle of fourths is 1.4798 and not 1.5. 
 Listen to <natural sa- pa> and the <cycle of fourth sa-pa> and the <two pa's>
 one after the other. Calculation of the frequencies by cycle of fifths and fourths 
 gives two sets of values for the notes differing by the fraction 81/80 which has 
 dogged musicians especially for orchestration involving extensive harmony.    
 From these pairs of notes the following set of simple fractions are generally 
 mentioned for 'natural notes':

 ^sa%     (ri1)    ri2  (ga1)  ga2  ma1  (ma2)   ^pa%   (da1)  da2   (ni1)   ni2   ^Sa%
  1     16/15  9/8    6/5    5/4    4/3   45/32    3/2   8/5     5/3    16/9  15/8    2
 
 Although 9/8 (ri2) and 3/2 (^pa%) have a relative ratio of 4/3, the ratio between
 da2 (5/3) and ri2 (9/8) is 40/27 and not 3/2.  There is no way  to have every pair
 of notes separated by 7 or 5 notes to have the perfect 3/2 or 4/3 ratio .   As this 
 problem caused difficulties in orchestration, western system has adopted a
 scheme in which every adjacent pair of notes has the same r.f of twelfth root
 of 2 - about 1.05946.  This  is called the 'equally tempered scale'. In this scheme 
 ^ma% and ^pa% are 1.3348 and 1.4983 instead of 1.3333 and 1.5, a difference not  
 usually distinguishable by the human ear (0.1 percent).  ~
                                              @Notes - on strings $                           

 The idea of simple ratio for notes can be illustrated on stringed instruments.
 Most stringed instruments have a few strings only and notes are produced by
 damping a part of the string (on the finger board on a violin or on the frets
 in ^Veena% or Guitar) and making the rest vibrate.  By damping lengths which are
 simple fractions like 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 etc. we can get pleasant notes of r.f. 2,3/2,4/3
 etc. The relative frequency is the reciprocal of the vibrating part fraction. The 
 ratios 2 (^Sa% of upper octave), 3/2 (^pa%), 4/3 (ma1), 5/4 (ga2) and 6/5 (ga1) are all 
 natural notes because of their simple ratios.  7/6 and 8/7 are however not used 
 but 9/8 (ri2) and sometimes (10/9) are used. The sketch below shows how notes 
 are generated by damping part of a 60 cm long string.~
                                              @Notes - on strings (2)$

 The process of cycle of fifths or fourths is actually visible on stringed instruments
 especially those with frets.  Different notes are produced on the different strings
 at a given fret.  The ^Veena% has its first string tuned to ^sa% and the next to lower
 ^pA% with r.f  3/4  (3/2  / 2).  Thus on every fret, the frequency of a note on the  
 pA string is 3/4th of the note on ^sa% string because the vibrating lengths are   
 reduced by the same proportion in both cases.  Against the pa fret of ^sa% string   
 we get ri2 on the pA string, against ri2 on ^sa% string we get dA2 on pA string,   
 against da2 of ^sa% string we get ga2 on the pA string and so on, generating the   
 same sequence of notes as in the cycle of fifths.  In fact this is how the frets are  
 placed.  If pa fret is placed correctly others can be placed by alternately   
 listening to notes produced on ^sa% and pA strings.  If we tune the second string to   
 ^mA% we will get the notes of the cycle of fourths.~
                                    @Notes used in Carnatic Music$
 The question as to the frequencies of notes used in Carnatic Music has been
 subject of much discussion.  The pairs of frequencies obtained by cycle of fifths
 and cycle of fourths have been equated with the 22 sruthis of ancient texts.  It
 is difficult to speak of frequency when a note is constantly oscillated, often with
 unequal timings of rest at the ends.  When ri1 of Saaveri is sung the voice
 remains most of the time in ^sa% and reaches ri1 quickly and comes back giving 
 the feeling of a very low ri1.  It is possible that the presence or absence of other
 notes with sa-pa or sa-ma relationship in a ^raagam% influences the pitch of 
 a note and the manner in which it is held.  However, some notes on the key-
 board (equally tempered scale) such as ga2 (r.f 1.26)  appear somewhat higher  
 for an ear accustomed to the natural ga2 (r.f 1.25  a difference of about 1 %)
 Listen to <sa-ga equally tempered>, <sa-ga natural> and the <two ga's>.

 Given below are the frequencies of equally tempered scale and one possible 
 set of  natural notes for ^sa% at 262 (261.62 to be accurate, which corresponds to 
 440 for for da2, standard used in western music). Black notes are in brackets.  
 Actually the black notes sound much lower in Carnatic Music as they are usually 
 oscillated from the lower note (except ma2 which is oscillated from ^pa% and 
 sounds higher).~
